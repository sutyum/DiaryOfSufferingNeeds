# Veritas Dolor — Truth in Suffering
## Mission
Curate a massive, ethically-sourced index of real medical suffering journeys. Use it as living ground truth for empathy training, needs research, and intervention design. Make suffering legible at scale without erasing its humanity.

## Seed Domains (start narrow, expand)
1. Chronic Pain (incl. back, fibromyalgia, neuropathy) — richest Reddit density
2. ME/CFS & Long COVID — profound energy/PEM texture
3. Rare Cancers & Sarcomas — diagnostic isolation + miraculous outliers
4. ... (next: invisible illnesses, mental-physical overlap)

## Story Structure (each entry)
- Source URL (public, archived)
- Anonymized metadata: year of onset, age band, gender neutral, primary condition(s), country rough
- Raw timeline (chronological events)
- Verbatim key quotes (paraphrased where needed for privacy)
- Emergent themes (tagged post-hoc: "loss of future self", "caregiver burden", "treatment iatrogenic harm", etc.)
- Outcome vector: physical, emotional, social, economic state at last update
- "What would have helped" self-reported fragments

Example Entry (from public NORD source, Sept 2019):
Condition: Stage 3 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (incidental finding)
Onset: July 2017, age 27
Timeline: Gallbladder scan → racquetball tumor on pancreas → move to MD Anderson → GemTax chemo (blood clot + liver spike) → radiation cancelled → Whipple Dec 13 2017 (cancer vanished—miracle) → long-term fatigue/back pain → moved back near center for integrative care.
Themes: Island of rarity, doctor unfamiliarity terror, treatment side-effect cascade, relocation stress, post-survival chronicity, power of specialized community + awareness work.
Quote (lightly adapted): "It felt like being on an island... then it became a small village."

## Tech-Agnostic Core Capabilities
- Semantic + structured search over index
- Composite story generation (never fabricate, always traceable)
- Visual synthesis (timelines, constellations, heatmaps)
- Agent swarm for intervention testing
- Soft-verification scoring against corpus density

## Growth & RLVR Path
Manual curation → semi-automated ingestion (human-in-loop) → massive index → RAG/RLM reasoning → verifiable reward models for intervention alignment.

Version history starts here. We stay honest: this is testimony, not data. Use it to reduce harm, never to exploit.
