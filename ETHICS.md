# The Witness Archive — Ethics Guardrails

## Core Principle
**This is testimony, not data. We use it to reduce harm, never to exploit.**

### 1. Sourcing & Consent
- **Public Posts Only**: We only curate from open, public forums (e.g., Reddit, publicly accessible patient networks) where users have implicitly shared their stories for broader visibility.
- **Community Respect**: We credit the platforms and spirit of the communities. We do not flood or spam forums with automated scraping that disrupts their operation.
- **Explicit Framing**: The archive includes explicit warnings: "This is patient testimony, not medical advice. It is preserved for understanding lived experiences and designing empathetic interventions."

### 2. Privacy & Anonymization
- **Full Anonymization**: All direct identifiers (names, specific locations, exact dates of birth, rare unique combinations) are stripped.
- **Paraphrasing**: Verbatim quotes are lightly paraphrased or adapted where searching for the exact text might lead back to the original author's profile, unless the author has explicitly published their story for public advocacy (e.g., NORD public patient stories).
- **No Re-identification Risk**: We strictly prohibit linking multiple datasets (e.g., cross-referencing forum posts with location data or other registries) that could triangulate and re-identify an individual.

### 3. Researcher Safeguards
- **Content Warnings**: Entries dealing with severe trauma, self-harm, or active medical crises are flagged so researchers can manage their emotional load.
- **Emotional Load Management**: We acknowledge the weight of this material and encourage researchers and designers to step away when the density of suffering becomes overwhelming.

### 4. Application & Use
- **Intervention Alignment**: The corpus must be used to score and test interventions for *alignment to unmet needs*. It should actively penalize interventions that invent new harms, add unnecessary financial burden, or result in patient gaslighting.
- **Never Fabricate**: When using Agent Swarms or composite persona generation, the outputs must be traceable back to real, documented thematic patterns. We never synthesize "hallucinated" trauma.
